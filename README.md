# CShell

This is a c++ project that serves as a development tool for beginners starting to learn c and c++. This project aims to support drag-and-drop programming with most features present in c. This project strives to add some IDE-like capabilities, such as containing an integrated terminal and containing limited file-browsing capabilities on a GUI powered by Qt. This mimics the concept of blueprints and other widget/UI-based programming: to make it as easy as possible for beginners who have no experience in programming to make programs without too much adaptation to immense levels of typing and memorization in creating programs. 

Goals: 
●	Support for parsing c files (with limited c++ support). 
●	Support drag and drop to create and edit c++ files. 
●	Contains integrated terminal. 
●	Code can be compiled within the CShell. Automatic code suggestions (provide warnings for the user and tell information, such as what types of parameters a function wants). 

Libraries used:
•	redi::pstreams
•	inotify
•	Qt
•	nlohmann::json
